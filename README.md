# Subdomain Enumerator - Find and Probe Subdomains
SubFind is a Bash script for Linux that automates subdomain enumeration and HTTP probing. It uses popular tools like amass, assetfinder, and subfinder to discover subdomains for a given domain, then leverages httpx to check their HTTP status. The results are saved in a file called subdomains.txt.
